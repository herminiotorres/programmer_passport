# The Groxio Programmer Passport

[The Groxio](https://grox.io) is a small company of educators, language geeks and authors who want to change the way people teach and learn languages and you can see more [about Groxio](https://grox.io/about).

#### Groxio: Career Fuel for Curious Coders
Science-backed `Elixir-focused training` and `guided self study` for `Elixir, LiveView, and more` to help you unlock your own potential.

Groxio's self-guided courses `embrace coders at different levels` with videos, books, and resource links.

#### Levels

2. Novice
3. Competent

Different Media Types for Accelerated Learning

__How It Works__: See the `book, videos, projects, exercises, and other web resources` in action in one of our guides.
__A Mini E-book__: `Beyond the trivial`, learn what makes each language tick in a book edited by the `Pragmatic Bookshelf`.
__Videos__: Each language comes with at least `two private videos`. Check [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5KlC4hhy_QlXEYPgRKvVA) to see a few free ones.
